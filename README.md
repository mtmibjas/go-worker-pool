# Worker Pool in Go

## Overview

This project implements a worker pool in Go, providing a concurrent execution mechanism for tasks. A worker pool is particularly useful when dealing with tasks that can be processed concurrently, such as parallelizing I/O-bound or CPU-bound operations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pool Sizing:** The worker pool dynamically adjusts its size based on the workload, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Task Queuing:** Queues tasks efficiently, ensuring they get processed as soon as a worker is available.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Supports graceful termination, allowing in-flight tasks to complete before shutting down.

## Configuration
You can configure the worker pool with parameters like the initial pool size, maximum pool size, and task queue size. Refer to the documentation or code comments for detailed configuration options.
